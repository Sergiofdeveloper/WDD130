    <p>Hi everyone. Greetings from Spain. I´ve been a member of the Church my whole life and I served a misison in England many years ago.</p>
    <p>I married the love of my life and we have 3 wonderful children.</p>
    <p>I just finished Pathway Connect which was a wonderful experience to me. I´m now working towards my applied technology degree.</p>
    <p>I took some classes of web development years ago, using Dreamweaver tools, so I´m excited to get back into it again.</p>
    <p>When I have some spare time I enjoy reading historic novels or playing PlayStation with my kids.</p>
    <p>I´m looking forward to know all of you and to work together.</p>
