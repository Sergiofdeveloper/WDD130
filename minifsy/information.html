                <h2>Cell Phones and other Electronic Devices</h2>
                <p>Youth are allowed to bring their mobile to Mini FSY. They will be asked to ONLY use their mobile devices to read the scriptures during the activities.
                    During free time and outside activities, the use of mobile phones is allowed. However, we recommend that all young people reduce the use of mobile phones to a minimum, 
                    even in their free time, in order to encourage socialization with the other participants and avoid the isolation of young people. If the young person thinks that it will 
                    be difficult for them to limit their use of the mobile, we recommend that they leave it in the room.
                    We trust that all young people are able to use the mobile phone appropriately and be responsible. If a young person is tempted to use their mobile during an activity for 
                    something other than reading the scriptures, we encourage them to use the paper scriptures instead of the mobile.</p>
