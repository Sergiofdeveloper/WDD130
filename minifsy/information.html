                <h2>All-inclusive</h2>
                <p>Youth from invited stakes will only pay €15 for the whole 3 days event. The rest of the cost will be cover by their respective wards.</p>
                <p>Payment will be made to their respective bishops through the tithe ballot. The last day to make the payment will be on july 17th.</p>
                <p>Every stake will arrange the transportation for their youth and leaders.</p>
                <p>Kids won´t need to pay for anything during the event. They are welcome to bring some cash for personal shopping.</p>

                <h2>Cell Phones and other Electronic Devices</h2>
                <p>Youth are allowed to bring their mobile to Mini FSY. They will be asked to ONLY use their mobile devices to read the scriptures during the activities.</p>
                <p>During free time and outside activities, the use of mobile phones is allowed. However, we recommend that all young people reduce the use of mobile phones to a minimum, 
                even in their free time, in order to encourage socialization with the other participants and avoid the isolation of young people.</p>
                <p>We trust that all young people are able to use the mobile phone appropriately and be responsible. If a young person is tempted to use their mobile during an activity for 
                something other than reading the scriptures, we encourage them to use the paper scriptures instead of the mobile.</p>
