      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>As a youth supervisor for my local church, I ́m part of the committee in charge of setting up a 
        youth camp that will be held in early August. That camp will be placed on the mountains 
        nearby and youth and leaders from around 250 miles will be attending. To be able to better 
        channel the information we need to set up a website where parents, leaders and kids may 
        visit. 
        In this website I ́ll be posting the information and documents related with the 
        event such us: activities, schedules, location, registration form and frequently asked questions. 
        It ́ll be a user-friendly website that will save a lot of time and efforts to both attendants and 
        coordinators. </p> 


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p> This website is meant for the benefit of parents, leaders and youth from the ages 11 to 13 that will be attending 
        or somehow related with this activity. In its pages everybody may find all the information about the event, schedules, 
        location and how to be part of this amazing event and enjoy all the cool activities, firesides and games that will be 
        taking part in it.

      <H4>Welcome to the Mini FSY 2022</H4>
      <p>Our dear bright young people, we are back! It seems that there are signs of improvement from the COVID-19 Pandemic and, little by little, we are returning to a certain normality.

Each one of us, as a team, as well as you, will contribute together many feelings, experiences and experiences during this complicated time that we have lived, but also precious experiences of growth by living the Gospel of Jesus Christ more fully centered in our homes.
        Please prepare yourselves both physically and spiritually for this magnificent event. Let no one take your place in it and prepare to receive revelation for your lives and strength for your testimonies of Jesus Christ and His Atonement. Remember every moment who you are and what purpose you have in this life in preparing the world, on both sides of the Veil, for the Second Coming of Jesus Christ.</p>

      <h4>Cell Phones and other Electronic Devices</h4>
        <p>Youth are allowed to bring their mobile to Mini FSY. They will be asked to ONLY use their mobile devices to read the scriptures during the activities.
        During free time and outside activities, the use of mobile phones is allowed. However, we recommend that all young people reduce the use of mobile phones to a minimum, 
        even in their free time, in order to encourage socialization with the other participants and avoid the isolation of young people. If the young person thinks that it will 
        be difficult for them to limit their use of the mobile, we recommend that they leave it in the room.
        We trust that all young people are able to use the mobile phone appropriately and be responsible. If a young person is tempted to use their mobile during an activity for 
        something other than reading the scriptures, we encourage them to use the paper scriptures instead of the mobile.</p>
