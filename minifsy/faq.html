                <div class="content">
                <p>You can wear whatever you want, as long as you honestly follow what is outlined in For the Strength of Youth, which is as follows:</p>
                <p>"Immodest clothing is any garment that is tight-fitting, see-through, or otherwise provocative. Girls should avoid shorts that are too</p>
                <p>short ("short shorts"), skirts that are too short (miniskirts), T-shirts or blouses that do not cover the midriff and garments that do not</p> 
                <p>cover the shoulders or are extremely low-cut in the front or back.Young men should also keep their appearance modest. Young men and women </p>
                <p>should be neat and clean and avoid being extreme or inappropriately casual in dress, hairstyle, and behavior.</p>
                </div>
            <button type="button" class="collapsible">Can I bring a friend?</button>
                <div class="content">
                <p>Sure! We´d loved you to. Your friends must be the same age as the rest of the participants and they need to have</p>
                <p>an interview with their local bishop to make sure they understand all the requirements of Mini FSY</p>
                </div>

                <div class="content">
                <p>Unfortunately not.</p>
                <p>We are required to pay for accommodation, food, supplies and other items to be used in the session before the session begins.</p>
                <p>Even if you attend only a few days, the contract requires us to pay as if you had been the whole week. So we cannot make </p>
